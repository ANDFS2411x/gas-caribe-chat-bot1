## 🤖 Artificial Intelligence Integration

- Uses the `google.generativeai` library to connect with **Gemini 1.5 Flash**.
- Each question is answered based on:
  1. A **system prompt** that limits the scope to company-specific topics.
  2. The **PDF content** extracted as context.
  3. The **chat history** to maintain coherent conversation.
- The response generation is fine-tuned using temperature, top-p, and token limits to balance creativity and reliability.
